## 🚀 EOMP — Everyday One Mini Project

**EOMP (Everyday One Mini Project)** is a personal challenge:  
Build 100 mini projects using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

No excuses. No tutorials copy-paste.  
Just consistency, creativity, and daily improvement.

## 🎯 The Mission
``Create one mini project every day.``

Each project is:
- Small
- Focused
- Practical
- Built from scratch
- Designed to improve real frontend skills

The goal is ``not perfection``, the goal is ``progress``.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Vanilla JavaScript

No frameworks.
No libraries (unless a specific challenge requires learning one later).
Just fundamentals.

## 🧠 Why?

Because ``mastering the basics makes everything else easier``.

Frameworks change.  
Trends change.  
``Fundamentals don’t``.

This project is about:
- Discipline
- Problem solving
- DOM manipulation
- Layout mastery
- Real-world logic
- Becoming dangerous with pure JavaScript

## 📁 Structure

Each mini project lives in its own folder:
- /001-???
- /002-???
- /003-???
- ...
- /100-???

Simple. Organized. Scalable.

## 📈 The Long-Term Goal

By the end of 100 projects:

- Stronger logic
- Faster development
- Cleaner code
- Better UI sense
- Portfolio full of proof

Not just “``I know JavaScript``.”

But:

“``I built 100 things with it``.”

## ⚡ Rules

1. One project per day.
2. Finish what you start.
3. Refactor when needed.
4. Keep it simple.
5. Keep going.

``Consistency`` > Motivation.
